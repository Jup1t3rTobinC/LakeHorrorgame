# The-Cabin-On-The-Shore
A short semi horror game

This is a short horror game I made back in December of 2021, I never got around to fully releasing it, but it's done finally.

I wanted to focus a lot on establishing a believable environment, and doing a lot more work with sounds at the time. I think I managed to establish a good tone and visual style, though it is a bit dark, literally not figuratively.
