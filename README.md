# The-Cabin-On-The-Shore
#### A short atmospheric semi horror walking simulator

## Gameplay
Its basic WASD movement, I didn't program in controller support so it probably isn't functional.
This game is a walking simulator!

## Retrospective
This is a short horror game I made back in December of 2021, I never got around to fully releasing it, but it's done finally.
I wanted to focus a lot on establishing a believable environment, and doing a lot more work with sounds at the time. I think I managed to establish a good tone and visual style, though it is a bit dark, literally not figuratively.

## Motivation
This was when I making this I was just coming off of failing to complete a larger and more grandiose project, granted I didn't get far in (I'm sensing a theme here). I really liked the visual style I got, and I nailed the environment vibes. The jumpscare in this game was kinda just inserted in, I think thats one of my weaker points, doing the release of the tension. I enjoyed working on this project though, it's very satisfying to complete projects like this.
